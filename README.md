# 🗣️ Object Whisperer

Ever wonder what your coffee mug *really* thinks about your Monday morning attitude? Or what stories your old sneakers could tell? Object Whisperer lets you eavesdrop on the secret lives of everyday things. Point your camera at stuff around you and let the AI magic reveal their hidden personalities.

*Warning: May cause existential crises about the consciousness of inanimate objects* 

## ✨ What it does

- Makes your stuff talk back (finally!)
- Each object gets its own weird personality
- Real-time object spotting that mostly works
- Surprisingly decent robot voices
- Won't blind you on dark mode
- Works on phones (because who brings a laptop to talk to their houseplants?)

## 🛠️ Dev Setup 

First time? Here's how to get this strange experiment running locally:

```bash
# Feed the JavaScript monster
npm install

# Copy the secrets (and pray you have them)
cp .env.example .env
```

## 🚀 Launch this bad boy

```bash
# Let it rip!
npm run dev
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000 and start questioning reality.

## 🎯 Known Features (aka Happy Accidents)

- Objects usually get recognized (unless they're having an identity crisis)
- Runs pretty smooth on phones (tested on mine, anyway)
- The UI won't make your eyes bleed
- Caches stuff so your toaster doesn't have to think too hard about its existence every time

## 🤔 Philosophy Corner

This started as a "what if..." experiment that got way out of hand. Now I can't look at my furniture the same way. Use responsibly.

## MAC USERS
I'm sorry but since I don't have a mac to test this, I don't know how to execute the project on a Macbook, or any device.
